The Virginia Truckee is by far the most famous of all American short lines. In its heyday, as many as 45 trains per day arrived and departed Virginia City. U.S. presidents and dignitaries from the world over rode the ornate VT trains. Completed in 1869, the VT R.R. hauled millions of dollars in gold and silver ore from the mines of Virginia City. Today, 80 years after the last train left the Comstock, you can once again ride over this historic railroad. Today, the Virginia Truckee Railroad operates 100 year old steam engines and heritage diesel locomotives departing from the original 1870 depot in Virginia City at 166 F Street. The conductor-narrated trains take ticketed passengers through some of the most famous of the bonanza Comstock mines and ruins. You may even see wild horses run alongside the tracks. The Virginia Truckee Railroad offers 7 daily train rides from the last week in May thru the end of October. Special family event trains are offered throughout the season: Heritage Days and Battle Trains run throughout Labor Day Weekend including a Saturday evening Champagne Battle Train.

Fred has been with the VTRR for 13 years and was hired on because of his photography expertise and his love of Comstock History. He created the large format historic photos that adorn our Pullman passenger cars and rides the Carson City-Virginia City route as a conductor and historian. You can also find him running our gift shops at both depots. A model train enthusiast, Fred has 30 years experience in retail management and says he loves the variety of work the VTRR offers. Fred loves to talk trains and history with our riders. Dave Bell ConductorTicket Agent Dave has been with the VTRR since 2004. He began as Brakeman and Conductor and he is now the Lead Conductor, as well as ticket agent and chief storyteller. Dave is also a part time Geology instructor at Truckee Meadows Community College and can be found roaming the desert searching for specimens on his days off. His favorite part of being a Conductor is talking to the people and says no two trips on the railroad are the same. Dave knows a lot about the history of the VT actually, he knows a lot about a lot of subjects! Book a ride on the VTRR this summer and find out for yourselves! Ed Sims Ed Fireman Extraordinaire If a steam locomotive is running you can be pretty sure that Ed will be sitting on the left side of the cab, tending the fire box and ringing the bell. Ed has worked as the Steam Locomotive Fireman for the VTRR for the last 15 years. He considers himself a Jack of All Trades and has worked on steam engines for the best part of 44 years, at a variety of railroads including Roaring Camp and Big Trees in Felton, CA. His favorite part of the job is working with his Steam Engineer, Brian Covey, and the rest of the crew. His least favorite part is getting up at 3am to get the locomotives fired up and ready to roll. Book a ride with us this summer and be sure to give Ed a wave! Our crew members are passionate about their jobs and they love sharing that with our passengers. Darnel George Brakeman Darnels smile and great attitude make him a valued member of our team. His interest in railroading began at the age of 12 when he volunteered for the Nevada State Railroad Museum. When he heard of the newly reconstructed VT Railway, he rode his bicycle up to our Eastgate depot before he even got his drivers license, hoping there might be an odd job he could do. His perseverance was impressive, so Tom Gray eventually hired him and has been training him to do a variety of jobs. Darnel says there are no bad parts to his job, and that he loves the variety and opportunity to learn new skills every day. He is currently a Brakeman and part time fireman. Darnel is also a member of the Washoe Tribe. Our crew members enjoy sharing the history and knowledge they have learned on the VTRR, book a ride with us this summer and see for yourself! Brian Covey Steam Locomotive Engineer Brian has been our steam engineer since 2000. He was just 19 years old when he started. He states I love the history. I am an old soul, so I think its fascinating to do a job thats been unchanged for 100 years. The sounds, the smells and using your senses to operate the machine is something that is hard to come by in the modern world where almost everything is dependent on a computer. With that being said, these machines can give you a very hard time. They get into moods and are never the same from day to day. But that is all part of the fun. A talented musician, Brian also plays music a few nights a week, when he is not wrestling with one of our steam engines. Book a ride with us this summer and see Brian perform his magic touch with our steam locomotives. Bill Willets Diesel Engineer While the VTRR steam engines are the stars of our operation, the workhorses are our diesel engines. Our diesel Engineer, Bill Willets, has over 45 years experience in the cab. He retired from a career with the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads and started working for the VT 11 years ago. Bill is always striving to be as safe as possible and like the rest of our crew, loves seeing the enjoyment of our passengers. We run our diesel trains on selected weekdays, so if you find yourself in Virginia City on a weekday, book a trip with us and you will benefit from Bills expertise. Tyler Marty Student FiremanEngineer Meet one of the youngest members of our crew, Tyler Marty. Tyler, age 16 and a student at Petaluma High School, has been a student firemanEngineer Since July 2021, but hes been hanging around the VTRR with his dad, speeder driver Ken Marty since he was just 7 years old. Tyler says the best part of his job is knowing we are all family. He states that the worst part is all the maintenance required to keep all the historic equipment operating. Ive always wanted to pursue the railroad as a career, and I know my future plans will include railroading he says. What Does Tyler want you to know about working on the VTRR? I love my job and what I do its a great career choice, the stories in the cab are great, and most of all the people are great. Its not every day you get to say I work on steam engines for a living especially in high school. The amount of living history we have is pretty amazing and worth the trip.

    "content": "Nevadas Virginia and Truckee Railroad by Stephen Drew Compre at Amazon.com Other historical publications available from the Virginia Truckee Railroad Historical Society Espanol Aleman Francais Nevadas most famous short line is the Virginia Truckee Railroad which connected Reno with Carson City, Virginia City, and Minden. Operating for 80 years, the VT was Nevadas Bonanza Railroad as it hauled valuable Comstock ore to quartz reduction mills located at Silver City and along the Carson River. Today visitors to Virginia City enjoy a ride over nearly three miles of the original line amidst encouraging prospects that rails my soon once again reach the outskirts of Carson City. The name Virginia Truckee is recognized the world over: VT locomotives and cars have appeared in scores of feature-length motion pictures and the historic equipment is preserved and exhibited in museums in Nevada, California, and as far away as Strasburg, Pennsylvania. The VT enjoys an international constituency. The Virginia Truckee Railroad Company was organized in Nevada on March 5, 1868. The objective was to connect Comstock ore producing mines with quartz reduction mills and, on the return trip, to bring in needed lumber, mining timbers and cord wood for fuel. Surveyed by local surveyor Isaac E. James, the 21-mile standard gauge line was completed on January 29, 1870 between Carson and Virginia City. A 31-mile extension north from Carson City through Franktown, Washoe City, and Steamboat Springs connected the Comstock with transcontinental rail service at Reno in August of 1872. Primarily controlled by William Ralston, Darius O. Mills and William Sharon on behalf of the Union Mill Mining Company and the Bank of California, the Virginia Truckee was efficiently managed by General Superintendent Henry M. Yerington and immediately became a paying success. The completion of the VT permitted the further development of Comstock mines by allowing the economical reduction of lower grade ores through reduced freight rates to the mills and by increasing the essential supply of lumber, mining timbers, and cord wood for fuel. In addition, well-appointed passenger service to Carson and Virginia City was a by-product of the short lines connection with transcontinental rails at Reno. For nearly twenty years the VT was a major political and economic factor in the growth and development of Western Nevada and Eastern California. During the late 1870s, VT stockholders divided handsome dividends in excess of $100,000 monthly. Additional financial returns provided the capital for nearly 40 other VT-affiliated concerns. The 300-mile Carson Colorado Railroad was built from Mound House, Nevada, to Keeler, California, and was operated by principals of the VT from 1880 to 1900. VT dividends funded the establishment of Hawthorne, Nevada, the Hawthorne Water Works, lumbering operations at Lake Tahoe and Southern Nevada, the Columbus Wagon Road to Bodie, a large soda plant at Keeler, and dozens of mining ventures at Aurora, Bodie, Hawthorne, Candelaria, Belleville, Columbus, and Cerro Gordo. Headquartered at Carson City, a massive complex of railroad shops were erected under the direction of Abraham Curry. The shops were proclaimed by the Central Pacific to be equal to or better than their great locomotive and car building facilities at Sacramento. From these shops poured nearly every conceivable type of essential machinery for communities throughout Nevada, Eastern California, and even Mexico. For decades the Virginia Truckee was hailed as the wealthiest short line railroad in the world! With revenues derived from the twentieth century Tonopah boom, a new Virginia Truckee Railway Company was incorporated in Nevada on June 24, 1905 to purchase the predecessor company and to construct a 15-mile branch south from Carson City to Minden. This branch offered transportation facilities to a growing agricultural and grazing district and resulted in substantial new revenue to the railway until such time as a surface highway was constructed between Reno, Carson City, and Minden in the years 1921-1922. Known today as U.S. Highway 395, the concrete highway completely paralleled the VT between Reno and Minden and ultimately was the cause of the railways red ink operations beginning in 1923. Prior to that time, the VT was the only efficient means of transportation for freight and passengers between these communities. During the period 1932-1937, Ogden L. Mills, one of the major stockholders, loaned the railway nearly $95,000 to balance operating deficits until the line was forced to enter voluntary Federal receivership on April 27, 1938. Solid corporate status was not established again until January 18, 1946, under the financial direction of former VT Auditor Gordon A. Sampson. Starting in 1937, the railroad began selling capital assets to meet monthly working capital obligations. The disappearance of Comstock traffic and the caving of several wood-lined tunnels ushered in the closing of the Carson-Virginia City line in 1938. The rails were removed and sold in late 1941. The resulting $52,000 revenue was again applied as working capital on routine maintenance which had been deferred for over a decade. Additional working capital also came from selling old VT locomotives and cars to Hollywood studios for use in motion pictures. For the twenty year period from 1928-1947, the VT had a net income deficit of $440,605.75 by U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission accounting practices. As early as 1932, officials of the VT seriously considered total abandonment of the railway in the face of annually mounting loses. After 80 years of continuous operation, the Virginia Truckee finally succumbed to the increasing competition of highway truck traffic. The Bonanza short lines last official revenue train operated on May 31, 1950 between Reno, Carson City, and Minden. Following the local sale of the railways structures and properties, the rails between Reno and Minden were finally removed and the famous VT became but a legend. (Stephen Drew has been researching the VT for more than four decades. For the past 30 years, he has been Chief Curator of the California State Railroad Museum in Old Sacramento.)
